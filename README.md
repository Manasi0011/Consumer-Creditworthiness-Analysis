# Consumer-Creditworthiness-Analysis

This machine learning project falls within the banking domain and involves utilizing banking data to assess the status of loan approvals. Given the substantial influx of loan applications that banks receive daily, the higher management has recognized that this process consumes a significant amount of employees' time. Moreover, due to the high volume of loan applications, it has become challenging to effectively sift through and identify the suitable candidates for loan approval.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this endeavor is to construct a machine learning model using historical banking data. This model will serve to assist bank employees in efficiently evaluating and selecting suitable candidates for loan approval.

## Tools used:
